Simple camera app
This app can help you capture photo from system camera and save photo to system gallery.


Target User:
Everyone who wants to take pictures and share them to others.


The main improvement after user study:
You can save more than one picture launch system gallery app instead of create a new one.

The interesting and important part I have learnt from this:
Using onClick() method to respond to when user tapping button
